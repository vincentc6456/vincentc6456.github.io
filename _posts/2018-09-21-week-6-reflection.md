This week was rather interesting for me as we discovered and began working with a new program setting. Graph charts or tables, It made no sense to me why we were using this type of thing or why it's relevant. However something did come to mind as I made possiblw connections of we why did this kind of thing as It taught us to work together with person drivng and the person who is the thinker. We collabarated and managed to work through with a better mind and process. I was suprised upon this new advantage of working with a partner which gave me thought we connected another thing was pair thinking practice. One challenge was well personally for me doing things like these again. In other words working with one computer. But other then this i might do this pair thinking again. It was...Meh and okay but one problem for me was it kinda was boring with the lack of interest and lots of issues with things around me happening. Other then this I was doing pretty good. I look foward...maybe to next thing our teacher has in store for us.
