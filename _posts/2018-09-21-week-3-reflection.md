So far, We learned about coding. We tried out Pyret coding which was similar to what I did last year. It was strange because of the vague information to be recalled. We also asked questions about previous time and mine was " What was the first ever computer like ". For me I thought it could be well a rather small and blandness with a major amount of discolor. we also had a class discussion which was about why code does that and that alogn with teachering other students. It was rather okay and better along with a good feeling of understand things
We also worked on possibly creating a program that allows us to make a flag through code.pyret.org. What I'm troubling so far is rotating images and getting a varible useable too. I'm good at what I will be creating and my idea.
