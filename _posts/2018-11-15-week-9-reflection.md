For this week we have been focusing on lines of code that is all about the studying of tables. We also connected this lesson back to our group pairing session a month back where we used a code of booleans. We had a chart where we had a list of pets of their names, age , species and etc. We had to also learn about well the ows and columns. This connects to the forming of the chart and because we had a task os specfic data, we used a code back then in order to this. shapes.row-n(#)[""] . That was the code but since we had a new chart , it was modified to being. "Animals-table.row-n(#)[""]". difficulies while doing this was at the beginning of the lesson as I couldn't understand what to do but over time i managed but faced with another prolem which was the school connection to the internet that hindered me from proceeding to learn. some of the easy thing was well recover from this problem by the aids of my fellow classmates to support me through by sharing how to do the assignment.:large_blue_diamond:
