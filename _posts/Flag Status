So far my flag project isn't going so well. At the moment I'm having major difficulties still with my code at the moment. My Rectangle base is all set however my triangle isn't. What I need to work on is figuring how the code transforms the triangle's apperance. That is what I'm having difficult with, but what is easy was using what I have understood already

include image

size = 100

width = size * 8

height = size * 5

RR = rectangle(400, 200, "solid","red")
RT = triangle-sas(380, 50, 280, "solid", "blue")
