From today we were learning about shapes onto code and to create flags out of them. Japan was our example to use as which wasn't simple as such slapping on a white retangle and red circle in the middle. However we found out it was rather also important to figure out its exaxt measurement. On wedsday was our time with a big lecture again , after that 20 minutes we messed with code which help made our projects easier. My difficulties were just figuring how to combine my shapes in multiple images. what was easy was figuring out the basic another problem is just me having difficult is postioning where the shapes would either be located and etc.
