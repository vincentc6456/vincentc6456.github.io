From today we were learning about shapes onto code and to create flags out of them. Japan was our example to use as which wasn't simple as such slapping on a white retangle and red circle in the middle. However we found out it was rather also important to figure out its exaxt measurement. On wedsday was our time with a big lecture again , after that 20 minutes we messed with code which help made our projects easier. My difficulties were just figuring how to combine my shapes in multiple images. what was easy was figuring out the basic another problem is just me having difficult is postioning where the shapes would either be located and etc. I was quiet on that day but tried particpting and suprisingly I knew what to do sorta. Thursday wasn't my best because I made jokes which Mr.Allata made and I couldn't help but say something. But after that, I was on track and doing well. We first learned about Student Reflections with much higher standards to work as we read other student's work to compare what is our responses. For me I saw this a opportunity to learn their learning to make it my own kind of reflections to self improve
