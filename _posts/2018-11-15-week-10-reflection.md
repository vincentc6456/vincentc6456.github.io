For this week we have went through a baseline assessment and a entire test the day after. It was a huge mass of stress but a big wave of reief when it was finally accomplished. However during the test i came across a question which looked very familiar. The question was about Values of arguements. Values are what computer uses to understand what is being typed up. scale(2, circle(40, "solid", "blue"))  was the question about however it wanted us to identify which is the 3rd arguement within the innmermost function. The answer was "Blue" because it is within the third placement and inside the inner function. It wasn't the other answers is because one of them was on the outside while the other 2 were within the inside however was not in the correct value placement to be correct. This question is the Mastery 1 because of the fact it's exactlt talking about Values
