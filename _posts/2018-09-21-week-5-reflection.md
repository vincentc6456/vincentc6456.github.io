So far I have began working on trying to make the Chinese Flag which was rather complex to my abilities. I needed to figure out the exact measurments of the flag but the fact of understanding preciously where it should be located , and cutting out the shapes was also rather difficult. That was my challenge but due to this challenge it gave me a opporunity to figuring it out rather easily on computer, I was able to make everyshape preciously because of the computer able to create the shapes finely. However yet again came with another challenge of placing the images together was caused me to be at another pause, I didn't know what to do with those images or know how to place them together. Thats my issue til i found many optional merging.First I got my shapes which was the bases of my flag then I came acrosss Overlay,overlay xy and place image thingy. Tho One thing was undeniable was the fact I wasn't able to figure everything on my own. Therefore I had to ask my partners to help which was a game changer in my opinion because I never considered them as a resource till now recently when I was stuck. So far my lesson is to also trust in those around me that they can help
