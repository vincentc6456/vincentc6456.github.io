This week really bored me and I just lost every interest I had. I couldn't focus what so ever and could only understand what little there was as it was all I could do. What we leared were about concepts about string and data. The connections I remember were of that we have been using them for quite some time. Challenges this week was well...Keeping Interest and what was easy for me was just doing what I could.
