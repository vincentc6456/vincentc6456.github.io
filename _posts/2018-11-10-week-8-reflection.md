This week were talking about a new code stran which was used apparently within to describe: Cakes. I was having a major laugh in those first 2 days but however on the last day I just didn't seem in the mood. I was kinda understanding yet don't. I asked my classmates and teachers for help but to be honest, I acutally knew what I was doing and it was just I kept doubting my abilities to work. Some connections were it felt similar to having the same code of creating charts but I think this tool was more of decripting much more vital importance of info within the table then the simple one.
